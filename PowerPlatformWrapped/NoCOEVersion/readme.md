# Power Platform Wrapped No COE Version
This Power App gives you a way to provide your users with a year end recap of their Power Platform maker experience.  This version doesn't use any premium features and does NOT require that you have teh COE installed. This solution leverages a Power Automate flow and the Power Platform admin connectors to return the summary data. There is a Power App canvas app front end that a user can request their "wrapped" year end summary which kicks off the flow. The flow will send a summary email to the user with all of the data after the flow runs.


## First Time Setup Instructions

- Browse to this zip file location to install the solution which will install a flow and canvas app for you


## Disclaimer
Although the underlying features and components used to build the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit (such as Common Data Service, admin APIs, and connectors) are fully supported, the kit itself represents sample implementations of these features. Our customers and community can use and customize these features to implement admin and governance capabilities in their organizations.
