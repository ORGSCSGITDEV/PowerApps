# Power Platform Wrapped COE (Center of Excellence) Version
This Power App gives you a way to provide your users with a year end recap of their Power Platform maker experience.  This version relies on you having the Power Platform COE (Center of Excellence) installed in your environment.  This app gets all of it's data from the COE tables so it will not work if you don't have that installed and if your users don't have read access to the underlying tables.

## Disclaimer
Although the underlying features and components used to build the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit (such as Common Data Service, admin APIs, and connectors) are fully supported, the kit itself represents sample implementations of these features. Our customers and community can use and customize these features to implement admin and governance capabilities in their organizations.
